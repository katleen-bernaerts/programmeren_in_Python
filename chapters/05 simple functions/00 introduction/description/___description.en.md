Up to this point, I have already introduced some basic "functions," such
as `print()` and `int()`. In this chapter these functions will be
discussed a bit more in-depth, and a few other functions will be
introduced, which will be helpful in the coming chapters. In Chapter
<a href="#ch:functions" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ch:functions">9</a>,
I will discuss how you can create your own functions.
