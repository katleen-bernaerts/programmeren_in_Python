### Assignment

The code snippet below assigns a value of money (in cents) to the variable `amount`. Determine the maximum number of dollars that fit in the amount, then the maximum number of quarters that fit in the remainder after you subtract the dollars, then the maximum number of dimes that fit in the remainder after you subtract the dollars and quarters, and so on for nickels and pennies. The result is that you express the amount as the minimum number of coins needed.

### Output

Write the minimum number of coins needed to pay the given amount of money (in cents). Use the following output format:

```
Dollars: ???
Quarters: ???
Dimes: ???
Nickels: ???
Cents: ???
```
