The area of a circle with radius $$r$$ is computed as $$r \times r \times \pi$$, where $$\pi = 3.141592653589793$$.

### Assignment

The code snippet below assigns the radius of a circle to the variable `straal`. The value of $$\pi$$ is assigned to the variable `pi`. Your task:

1. Compute the area of the circle and assign it to the variable `area`. 

2. Print the following sentence that indicates the area of the circle:

   ```
   The area of a circle with radius ??? is ???.
   ``` 

   Obviously, the question marks must be replaced with the radius and the area of the circle.
