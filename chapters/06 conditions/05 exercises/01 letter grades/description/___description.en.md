Grading in the United States commonly takes on the form of five letter grades (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D` and `F`), with `A` being the highest and `F` being the lowest. Below is the grading system found to be most commonly used in United States public high schools for the conversion of numeric grades (percentages) to letter grades.
