When something is wrong with your
code, Python will raise errors. Often these will be "syntax errors" that
signal that something is wrong with the form of your code (e.g., the
code in the previous exercise raised a `SyntaxError`). 

 There are also
"runtime errors," which signal that your code was in itself formally
correct, but that something went wrong during the code's execution. A
good example is the `ZeroDivisionError`, which indicates that you tried
to divide a number by zero (which, as you may know, is not allowed).

### Assignment

Write a short program that raises a `ZeroDivisionError` when executed.
